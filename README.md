===============

This is the website for VEX Team 5327A of Gael Force Robotics based in Dublin, CA.
Here we update the rest of the community about our tournament progress and link others
to our various online organization components including our github repos, trello board,
and google calendar to help others by making our own progress available to them. We are 
committed to keeping our information open to help the community. If you have any questions
about anything you see on our website or on our GitHub, let us know!
